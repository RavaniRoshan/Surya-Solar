## üöÄ Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up the ZERO-COMP Solar Weather API on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.9 or higher)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (Python package installer)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/) (for cloning the repository)
- An account with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for database and authentication services.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. These variables are loaded from a `.env` file.

1.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    Copy the example environment file to create your own local configuration:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **Update the environment variables:**
    Open the `.env` file in your editor and replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration. The most critical variables to set up are:
    - `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL.
    - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase project's anonymous key.
    - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`: Your Supabase project's service role key.
    - `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for your Supabase PostgreSQL database.
    - `JWT_SECRET`: A strong, secret key for signing JWTs.
    - `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`: Your Hugging Face access token for downloading the Surya-1.0 model.
    - `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` and `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`: If you intend to test payment processing.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Once you have completed the installation and configuration steps, you can run the application and perform tests.

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run the following command from the root of the project directory:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Running Tests

This project uses `pytest` for testing. To run the full test suite, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

Ensure you have a separate test database or have configured your environment appropriately to run tests without affecting your development data.

## üìö API and Database

### API Documentation

The API is self-documenting, thanks to FastAPI. Once the application is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at the following URLs:

- **Swagger UI:** [`http://localhost:8000/docs`](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- **ReDoc:** [`http://localhost:8000/redoc`](http://localhost:8000/redoc)

These interfaces provide detailed information about each endpoint, including request and response models, and allow you to interact with the API directly from your browser.

### Key API Endpoints

- `GET /health`: Health check for the API.
- `GET /api/v1/alerts/current`: Get the most recent solar flare prediction.
- `GET /api/v1/alerts/history`: Retrieve historical prediction data.
- `POST /api/v1/users/register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /api/v1/users/login`: Authenticate and receive a JWT.
- `WEBSOCKET /ws/alerts`: Establish a WebSocket connection for real-time alerts.

### Database Schema

The database schema is managed by Supabase and defined in the `database/` directory. The key tables are:

- **`predictions`**: Stores all solar flare predictions generated by the Surya-1.0 model.
- **`user_subscriptions`**: Manages user accounts, subscription tiers (`free`, `pro`, `enterprise`), and API keys.
- **`api_usage`**: Tracks API requests for analytics and rate-limiting purposes.
- **`alert_notifications`**: Logs all alerts (WebSocket, webhook, etc.) sent to users.
- **`system_metrics`**: Records system health and performance metrics.

For the complete schema, including indexes, policies, and views, please refer to the `database/schema.sql` file.
