# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ZERO-COMP is a real-time solar flare prediction API and dashboard system built on NASA-IBM's Surya-1.0 model. The system provides enterprise-ready solar weather forecasting to industries that depend on space reliability, including satellite operators, power grid companies, and aviation firms. The platform offers tiered access through web dashboards, REST APIs, and real-time WebSocket alerts to help customers mitigate risks from solar weather events.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a satellite operator, I want to receive real-time solar flare predictions, so that I can proactively protect my satellite fleet from space weather damage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs solar flare predictions THEN the system SHALL execute the Surya-1.0 model every 10 minutes
2. WHEN a solar flare probability exceeds defined thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate severity classifications (low/medium/high)
3. WHEN predictions are generated THEN the system SHALL store results with timestamps in the database
4. IF a high-severity solar flare is predicted THEN the system SHALL trigger real-time alerts through WebSocket connections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a power grid operator, I want to access historical solar flare data through a web dashboard, so that I can analyze patterns and plan maintenance windows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs into the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current solar flare probability
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show a historical graph of the last 24 hours of predictions
3. WHEN historical data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide data export functionality in CSV format
4. IF the user has enterprise access THEN the system SHALL provide multi-endpoint dashboard views

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an aviation company, I want to integrate solar weather alerts into my existing systems, so that I can automatically adjust polar flight routes during solar storms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the API THEN the system SHALL provide REST endpoints for current and historical predictions
2. WHEN subscribing to alerts THEN the system SHALL support WebSocket connections for real-time notifications
3. WHEN integrating with external systems THEN the system SHALL support webhook notifications
4. IF API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business customer, I want different subscription tiers based on my usage needs, so that I can access the appropriate level of service for my organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up for free tier THEN the system SHALL provide web dashboard access only
2. WHEN a user subscribes to Pro tier ($50/month) THEN the system SHALL enable single alert endpoint and WebSocket access
3. WHEN a user subscribes to Enterprise tier ($500/month) THEN the system SHALL provide multi-endpoint dashboards, SLA guarantees, and CSV exports
4. IF payment processing fails THEN the system SHALL downgrade access appropriately and notify the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to be reliable and scalable, so that customers can depend on critical solar weather alerts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is operational THEN the system SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime for Enterprise customers
2. WHEN processing predictions THEN the system SHALL complete inference within 30 seconds of scheduled execution
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and provide backup recovery
4. IF system errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide monitoring alerts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with ZERO-COMP, I want comprehensive API documentation and client libraries, so that I can quickly implement solar weather monitoring in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing API documentation THEN the system SHALL provide interactive Swagger UI documentation
2. WHEN using the API THEN the system SHALL provide client libraries for Python and JavaScript
3. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL return consistent JSON response formats
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages with resolution steps
