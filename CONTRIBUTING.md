# ü§ù Contributing to ZERO-COMP

First off, thank you for considering contributing to ZERO-COMP. It's people like you that make open source such a great community. We welcome any and all contributions, from bug reports to feature requests and code changes.

## How to Contribute

We have a few guidelines that will help you get your contribution accepted.

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue on our GitHub repository. When you report a bug, please include the following:

-   A clear and descriptive title.
-   A detailed description of the problem, including steps to reproduce it.
-   The expected behavior and what you observed instead.
-   Any relevant logs, screenshots, or other information.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement to an existing one, please open an issue to discuss it. This allows us to have a conversation about your idea before you put in the effort to write code.

### Pull Request Process

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  **Set up your development environment** by following the instructions in the `README.md` file.
3.  **Make your changes.** Please ensure that your code follows the existing style of the project.
4.  **Add tests** for your changes. We use `pytest` for our backend tests. Please ensure that all existing tests pass and that you add new tests to cover your changes.
5.  **Update the documentation.** If you are adding a new feature or changing an existing one, please update the relevant documentation (e.g., `README.md`, `DEVELOPERS.md`).
6.  **Ensure your code lints.** We use `flake8` for linting our Python code.
7.  **Submit your pull request.** Make sure your pull request has a clear title and description of the changes you have made.

## Code Style

We follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code. We use `black` to format our code and `flake8` to lint it. Please ensure that your code is formatted and linted before submitting a pull request.
